        <h2>a community experiment</h2>
        <p>
          We invited artists to participate in immersive training on AR app development, in seminars with artists who
          each engage with site-specific interventions in their artistic practices and to examine the potential of
          mutually supportive exchanges between specific physical locations through the digital realm.
        </p>
        <h2>mushroom is a verb</h2>
        <P>
          Using the concept of fungal intelligence as a springboard, our artists were asked to consider the nature of
          the connections that encircle and extend a mycelial system and to investigate the possibility of applying
          fungal characteristics to human and more-than-human community building at the intersection of digital and
          physical spaces.
        </P>
