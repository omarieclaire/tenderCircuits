          content warning: genocide, colonial violence
          <p>
          How do you capture silence and what can one learn from being near it?
          <p>
          Using the underbelly of the deteriorating Gardiner Expressway as site of this exhibit, part of the AR Knot Residency, the artworks invite viewers to consider who is a witness, what is unseen, and where it is forbidden to speak about what you just saw.
          <p>
          The mycelial network and its surrounding flora and fauna have been witness to the same colonial violence, which ties racialized people’s histories and displacement together in oppression and resistance. What if the rhizome’s attempts at growth against barriers or destruction or the lessons learned through decay inform the choreographies of people acting against injustice? What if you see fungi as interconnected bodies and embedded communities with memory unsettling the land to move with them?
          <p>
          Tamil island culture carries a long tradition of celebrating its deep connection to nature for nourishment as evidenced in current daily rituals and practices. In times of drought, mushrooms found in tropical forests saved people in nearby villages from starvation, a knowledge passed down through generations which is still in use. The Indigenous people on the island named Veddas or “forest dwellers” remain engaged in longstanding nomadic practices of foraging, hunting, and moving with the land. Though current mainstream island approaches disregard these perspectives in favour of a narrative of managing nature as means to signal modernization and development to the rest of the world. To conceptualize the digital artworks, Indigenous, Black and Tamil ways of knowing informed my process. To think beyond what is concrete, human directed, and tangible is to go against colonial logic.
          <p>
          In contrast, the Gardiner Expressway located in Tkaronto, called a “monster” by its designer Bill Malone and seemingly devoid of nature, has been literally falling apart in front of us since 1958. A triumph of water, salt, and other elements that have been breaking down its structure to reclaim space over time. In 2009, this highway was a stage to more than 2000 Tamil people who ran up the Spadina Avenue ramp and blocked the major artery connecting the city. They cried, held each other, mourned what was to come, and chanted in protest against a genocide about to transpire well into the night. A highly televised event, which failed to consider what the people were about to lose, was far greater than the disruption caused to weekenders. 
          <p>
          The first island-wide pogrom against Tamils took place coincidentally the year the Gardiner Expressway came into existence, something kept out of the news then. What makes these historical events significant is the enforced silence. To beautify the island, the state has long deployed violence alongside alterations to the landscape. There has been an attempt to hide genocidal histories using a consumerist and colonial mode of aesthetic while banning any public memorialization or mourning. Can a decaying highway faraway serve as a monument to hold silence and grief or does it falter, unable to hold its weight?
          <p>
          Important Notes
          <p>
1/ The Gardiner Expressway and surrounding area and peoples in Tkaronto are located on the lands and homes of the Mississaugas of the Credit and the traditional territory of the Huron-Wendat, the Haudenosaunee, the Métis, and many other Indigenous nations. These lands also contain the memories of previous and ongoing genocides against Indigenous people by settlers. 
<p>
2/ The “Tamil island culture” in this text is specifically referencing Sri Lanka.
<p>
3/ In doing this site based work, accessibility considerations were centered to serve the local community. So often art exhibits are restricted by physical, socio-economic, and temporal limitations and with AR use there is an opportunity to rethink the parameters of what is possible.
The historical site is at Column 113/5 on Spadina Avenue but it is difficult to use a mobility device such as a wheelchair or walk on the terrain without hiking shoes. The height of the cracks may prove a further obstacle. Paved in stones, the ground treatment prevents people from utilizing the empty space for shelter, respite, or play. The heightened police surveillance of the underpass requires further consideration of who is allowed to explore the space.
<p>
4/ While the exhibit focuses on the colonial, ecological, and historical at this intersection of the highway, the conversation would be amiss if it didn’t continue asking what silences does this installation create?
<p>
To give flora and fauna agency and their stories changing ours is an ancient Tamil oral tradition meant to pass down lessons for contemplation. This practice is found in other cultures too even when we end up anthromorphizing animals or centering humans in many of these stories. My questions are for the mycelial network and moths, rather than supposing these are their stories, even as I undertook research on their behaviours and appearances with humans to piece together what I could find out.
