          "They can't all be butterflies..." is what Dan muttered as he left the room. (It also happens to be the title
          of this work.) His account of the winter moth, trapped between sliding windows from the other night, followed,
          through graphene walls. Why should a moth hope to be anything else? The pressures of the Lepidopteran kingdom
          were well known.
        </p>
        <p>
          It just happened that way. In a moment of despair, the group trailed Dan, turned south until the sidewalk
          ended. With the waters of the Lake at our toes, the decision was made to sit and rest in the pinkpurple light
          of the closing of the day. At that point, we had already been together for 865 minutes straight, the exact
          flight time to Incheon, without strong headwinds.
        </p>
        <p>
          We knew we were no closer to any conclusions for the work. However, one thing was clear. Ideas would be
          layered until there was no distinguishable mark of any contributor. The group would select a single emissary.
          The four-way relationship among butterflies, milkweed, soil fungi, and the parasite Ophryocystis
          elektroscirrha seemed important. There were contradictions in the research, and we felt, in general, the
          potential of contradictions was neglected.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ran our languid fingers through the sand. Some of us tried to pinch a single grain. When dog walkers went
          past, our tones lowered. Excited music from the beach club thudded the evening, and birds chirped. Dan started
          on particles in space, ranging from grains of sand to mountain-size chunks, fragments of the first moments of
          our universe, and the guarantee that it would eventually collapse upon itself, return to the emptiness. Yes,
          that also seemed important.
        </p>
        <p>
          The night came, and we went home. Except for Gaetano. He walked the shore for another hour. Collected some
          colourful stones with an ice cream cone in one hand. The air was cooled by a brisk wind from off the lake, and
          he caught sight of a collective shiver ripple through the crowd on its night stroll. A moment later, it stood
          before him. A beloved backdrop. A simple clapboard structure with its rooftop lookout tower designed by the
          architects of Chapman, Oxley & Bishop. A firm defunct before our parents were even born. Gaetano said the
          building reminded him of "...the last sighs of an empire."
        </p>

          A week later, a timer for one hour was set. A canvass was passed around the table. Everyone was ready. Brushes
          paint glitter glue. Another timer. Another canvas. Until ten of them leaned against the graphene wall. A
          speedy vote was held. Four works were selected. When the paintings were primed and the last sandwich
          disappeared, it was time for a dreaded discussion on intention, approach and other grand subjects. The
          consensus was, for a few precious hours, we did not think. Suffering went quiet. And that is all there was to
          it.
