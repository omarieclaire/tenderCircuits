        <p>
          Roberto Santaguida lives and works in Montreal (Canada) and Hamburg (Germany). Since completing his studies in
          film production at Concordia University, his films and videos have been shown at more than 300 international
          festivals. He has also taken part in artist residencies in numerous countries such as Iran, Romania, Germany,
          Norway, or Australia. Roberto is the recipient of the K.M. Hunter Artist Award, the Chalmers Arts Fellowship
          and a fellowship from Akademie Schloss Solitude in Germany. His artistic work is informed by the methods of
          coping, used in human and communitiesâ€™ activities to ease pain and the disquiet of the mind. He bears witness
          to subterranean forces, and the attempts to ignore and to hide: concealment becomes a form of survival, and
          revelation, a path to deliverance.
