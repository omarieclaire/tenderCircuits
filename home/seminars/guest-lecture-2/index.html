        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Hossein Khodabakhsh is an Iranian photographer and artist who has
          been interested in documentary photography for most of his career.
          His recent work fuses digital media and photography to create
          augmented reality counter-monuments through digital manipulation and
          interpretation. Regarding his winning submission, Khodabakhsh says:
          “Against Communal Amnesia is a counter monument for organized crimes
          committed by the Islamic government in my country, Iran, after the
          1979 revolution. Ambiguous 3D models are made from Google Earth
          images of a crime scene from the time of the crime until today
          through a digital process. The objects are combined with the real
          image of the crime scenes to tell the story of the land and to cause
          the audience questions and curiosity. My images are a stimulus for
          people to remember, a warrior to resist amnesia, and anyone who
          calls for amnesia.” In 2021, Khodabakhsh was the grand prize winner
          of the NSCAD Student Art Award.
