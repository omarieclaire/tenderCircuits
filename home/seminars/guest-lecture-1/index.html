        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Tamiko Thiel was awarded the 2018 iX Immersive Experiences Visionary
          Pioneer Award for her life work by the Society for Art and
          Technology Montreal. Born in 1957, she is a visual artist exploring
          the interplay of place, space, the body and cultural identity in
          works encompassing a supercomputer, objects, installations, digital
          prints in 2D and 3D, videos, interactive 3d virtual worlds (VR),
          augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI). Thiel
          received her B.S. in 1979 from Stanford University in Product Design
          Engineering, with an emphasis on human factors. She received her
          M.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 1983 from the Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology (MIT), with a focus on human-machine design
          at the Biomechanics Lab and computer graphics at the precursors to
          the MIT Media Lab. She then earned a Diploma (Master of Arts
          equivalent) in Applied Graphics in 1991 from the Academy of Fine
          Arts in Munich, Germany, specializing in video installation art.
        <p>
          Her first artwork, the visual design for the Connection Machine
          CM-1/CM-2 artificial intelligence supercomputer (1986/1987, and in
          1989 the fastest machine in the world) is in the collection of the
          Museum of Modern Art New York and the Smithsonian Institution. She
          began working with virtual reality in 1994 as creative director and
          producer of the Starbright World (1994-1997) online VR playspace for
          seriously ill children, in collaboration with Steven Spielberg, and
          her VR artwork Beyond Manzanar (2000, with Zara Houshmand), has been
          in the collection of the San Jose Museum of Art in Silicon Valley
          since 2002.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017 she was Google VR Tilt Brush artist in
          residence, creating the VR artwork Land of Cloud, winner of the 2018
          People’s Choice Award at the VRHAM VR festival in Hamburg. Other
          international exhibitions include the Istanbul Biennial, the
          International Center for Photography New York, the Design
          Museum/Pinakothek der Moderne Munich, the Institute of Contemporary
          Art London and Boston, the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography,
          The Photographers’ Gallery London, Fondazione Querini Stampalia
          Venice, Ars Electronica in Linz/Austria and the Centre Pompidou
          Paris. A founding member of the cyberartist group Manifest.AR, she
          participated in 2010 in the pathbreaking augmented reality (AR)
          intervention “We AR in MoMA,” an uninvited guerilla takeover of MoMA
          New York. Thiel’s ARt Critic Face Matrix at MoMA was featured in
          articles in the New York Times and on WNYC (National Public Radio).
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2011 she led the Manifest.AR Venice Biennial AR Intervention,
          placing her work series Shades of Absence in St Marks Place and the
          Venice Giardini. This led to an invitation to participate in the
          ISEA UNCONTAINABLE official parallel program to the 2011 Istanbul
          Biennial and to numerous commissions, including in 2018 the Whitney
          Museum NY commission for the AR installation Unexpected Growth (with
          /p), a dystopian coral reef formed of (virtual) plastic waste that
          bleaches in response to the number of people viewing it, which is
          now in their collection. In 2021 the Smithsonian Institution
          commissioned her AR installation ReWildAR, on rewilding the city,
          for their 175th anniversary show FUTURES.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021 she is a Sundance
          Institute Art of Practice Fellow. Previous awards and fellowships
          include the MIT Center for Advances Visual Studies, the Macdowell
          Colony, Eyebeam New York Art and Technology Center, WIRED Magazine,
          IBM Innovation Award for Artistic Creation in Art and Technology,
          Art Council England, Wellcome Trust, Japan Foundation and the Berlin
          Capital City Cultural Fund. As AR Artistic Advisor for the Caribbean
          Cultural Center/African Diaspora Institute from 2013-2016 she helped
          win a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation Cultural Innovation Fund
          for Mi Querido Barrio, an AR project in East Harlem. As AR artistic
          advisor for the Hidden Histories of San Jose Japantown project she
          helped them win an Immersive Technology in the Arts award from the
          Knight Foundation and Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020 she came full circle,
          returning to her roots in artificial intelligence with the deepfake
          AI artwork Lend Me Your Face! (with /p). This work premiered in the
          Götzendämmerung exhibit of the Artists Association in Haus der Kunst
          Munich. The Photographers Gallery London then commissioned a net art
          version Go Fake Yourself! in 2021. Thiel has taught and lectured
          internationally at Carnegie Mellon University, the MIT Media Lab,
          the Bauhaus-University Weimar/Germany, University of California San
          Diego, University of Southern California School of
          Cinema-Television, Berlin University of the Arts, Nanyang
          Technological University School of Art, Design and Media in
          Singapore and the University of Art and Design in Linz.
